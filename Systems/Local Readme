LIGO ECHO DETECTION SYTEM WITH MERLIN SUITE AND REALTIME VISUALIZATION 
## ###################################
This comprehensive system integrates:



1. Full SNR projection with realistic LIGO/Virgo noise curves
2. Template generation with corrected Schwarzschild reflection physics
3. Detection statistics with false alarm rates and significance
4. Complete pipeline for end-to-end analysis
5. Schwarzschild reflection calculator for accurate R_∞(ω)
6. Corrected transfer function with proper monotonicity
7. Merlin test suite (results-only version) - call print_results() to see only test outputs
8. Unified interface for both simulation and real data
9. Command-line interface for easy operation
